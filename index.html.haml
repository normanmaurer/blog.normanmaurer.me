        Netty in Action introduces the Netty framework and shows you how to incorporate it into your Java network applications. You'll learn to write highly-scalable applications without the need to dive into the low-level non-blocking APIs at the core of Java. You'll learn how to think in an asynchronous way as you work through numerous hands-on examples. You'll follow numerous examples that show you how to use Netty while you master the best practices of large-scale network apps.
