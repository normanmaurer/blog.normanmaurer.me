## Presentations

As part of my Job at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) I'm sometimes give presentations on various topics. Mostly on things related to the projects I'm working on like [Netty](http://netty.io) and [Vert.x](http://vertx.io).

Here you find various of those. This list is currently not complete but I will try to complete it over the time.

  * __High performance networking on the JVM - Lessons learned__, JAX, May 2013:  [Slides](/presentations/2013-jax-networking-on-jvm)
  * __Vert.x - The next-gen Polyglot Asynchronous Platform__, Eclipsecon EU, Nov 2013:  [Slides](/presentations/2013-eclipsecon-eu-vertx)
  * __Netty 4 - Network - Application development the easy way__, W-JAX, Nov 2013:  [Slides](/presentations/2013-wjax-netty)
  * __Vert.x - The next-gen Polyglot Asynchronous Platform__, JUG Frankfurt, Oct 2013:  [Slides](/presentations/2013-jugffm-vertx) . This is an extended version of the talk I gave at EclipseCon EU 2013.
