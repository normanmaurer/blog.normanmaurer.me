## Presentations

As part of my Job at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) I'm sometimes give presentations on various topics. Mostly on things related to the projects I'm working on like [Netty](http://netty.io) and [Vert.x](http://vertx.io).

Here you find various of those. This list is currently not complete but I will try to complete it over the time.
